// Long-audio windows for the 15 s encoder function .
// Audio up to `singleShotMaxS` is one window (the reference engines' single-shot rule). Longer audio is cut into windows of at most
// `windowS` seconds: each cut is searched inside [bandMinS, windowS] after the window start at a QUIET point (the reference engines'
// rule: RMS over 50 ms blocks, gate = max(0.004, 0.18 x peak RMS since the window start), the middle of the longest quiet run, ties to
// the point nearest `windowS`). When there is no quiet block the cut falls at `windowS` and the next window starts `overlapS` earlier;
// that boundary is stitched at word level around a split time placed at the lowest-energy block of the overlap (see Stitcher).
